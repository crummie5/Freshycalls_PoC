# [FreshyCalls](https://github.com/Crummie5/FreshyCalls) PoC
A simple dumper as PoC. That's what's trendy, isn't it? ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

This PoC uses [PssCaptureSnapshot](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processsnapshot/nf-processsnapshot-psscapturesnapshot) so it only works from Windows 8.1 or Server 2012 R2.

Enjoy!
